### Hi there 👋

- 👷 I recently finished my stint as a Ruby on Rails backend developer at [Barnardo’s](https://www.barnardos.org.uk/). Currently, I'm taking a break having worked on our house renovation before embarking on my next job. My plan is to start my new role in August or September, and I am open to waiting for the right opportunity.
Ideally I’d like to stay in the charity / tech for good area but I’m also open minded to work on something new.
